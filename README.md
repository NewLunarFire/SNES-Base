# Example SNES Project

This is an example project for SNES Assembly, that compiles into an SMC ROM file

It requires [WLA-DX](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx) by [Vile Helin](https://github.com/vhelin).

Build with `make`. This will result in a **Greenspace.smc** file. If you run
this file in an emulator, it should display a green background. If it doesn't,
something went wrong.
